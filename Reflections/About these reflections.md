# About these reflections

I am challenging myself to reflect on the past month and write goals for the next month.

The idea is to help keep myself inline and oriented at my goals - sort of like a new years resolution but with more course correction.

## Format
```
# The good
- what went well this past month

# The Bad
- what went poorly this past month

# The OK
- neither good nor bad, note worthy

# Next Month
## Plan
- high level overview of what I'm going to do next month
## Start
- habits that I want to form
## Quit
- habits that I have to unlearn
## Continue
- habits that I should continue / increase
## Goals
- metrics by which to measure my performance
```


## Caveats
these reflections are a censored version of my actual reflections. There are things that I am not comfortable sharing for professional and personal reasons.
