# About these reflections

I am challenging myself to reflect on the past month and write goals for the next month.

The idea is to help keep myself inline and oriented at my goals - sort of like a new years resolution but with more course correction.

## Format
```
# The good
- what went well this past month

# The Bad
- what went poorly this past month

# The OK
- neither good nor bad, note worthy
```


## Caveats
these reflections are a censored version of my actual reflections. There are things that I am not comfortable sharing for professional and personal reasons.
