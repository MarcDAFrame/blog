# January 2022 Reflections

January has been a big month of growth for me. I moved out to Banff, Alberta to ski for a few months before starting my career.

This month has been some of the highest of highs and lowest of lows in my life. I've had an amazing time, met amazing people, formed great habits and broken many bad ones. I've spent all of my free time exactly how I had hoped to, skiing, partying and coding. But I feel empty for it, both by lack of energy and lack of meaning. Lack of energy attributed to partying, over stimulation and poor sleep health living in a hostel and lack of meaning because of the blur of faces I've met, lack of meaningful relationships, meaningful conversations and meaningful pursuits.

I have been guided by a philosophy of cutting out everything that isn't good for me (some more successfully than others).

## The Good
- I've worked out every day
    - skiing over 14 of the 25 days I've been here
    - minimum 100 pushups, 5 minutes of planks (2 mins, with 1 min of break)
- I've been very confident and comfortable in my own skin
- I've been very reflective 
- Journaling most days, feelings and memorable events of the day
- I've gotten very good with remembering people's names
    - I used to have almost a phobia of names
- I created my portfolio website
- I began my first steps in building in public (starting a blog, posting on social media)
- quit many bad habits
    - eating junk food, no candy, no chips...
    - drinking coffee, I've had two cups of coffee this month
- I've cut down substantially on Youtube, Netflix...

## The Bad
- going out a lot, 4+ nights a week
    - this has had a detrimental affect on my sleep, energy and overall health
    - it has, however, been very fun

## The OK
- I've overestimated how much I like skiing
    - my friends are fanatics, I can't keep up!
- I slowed down with journaling
- I didn't do weekly reflections as I had hoped to 
    - this may have to be something I ease into



# Next Month
## Plan
I plan to stay in Banff for another month and return to Toronto with a job.

I want to keep my momentum following the release of mframe.ca by picking up a "Monthly MVP" 

## Start
- build in public
    - I will post frequent updates of my projects
    - Monthly MVP will be a series (blog, social media...) chronicling my builds
- stretch everyday
- start selling uPolicy, learn how to be a better salesman
- living by a schedule
    - **monday - thursday**: ski
    - **friday - sunday**  : code
    - **saturday** : party
- on the bus ride, reflect and take notes on what I've read about from the previous day(s)

## Quit
- going out so much / drinking so much
    - bad for the wallet, waste line and time management
- using reddit so much, read hackernews, dev.to more
    - remove my subscribed subreddits to be in line with "cutting out everything that isn't good for me"

## Continue
- workout everyday, increase the pace to 200 pushups a day and 10 minutes of planks
    - don't get discouraged if I don't make these goals right away
- cooking and eating healthy
- staying in contact with good friends

## Goals
- make a sale of uPolicy
- write 4 blogs
    - "github as your cms" in reference to the `mframe.ca` github cms blog
        - [source code](https://github.com/MarcDAFrame/SvelteGithubBlog)
    - "Monthly MVPs" outlining my plans for a Monthly MVP
    - "Strategy for building in public"
    - "Notedown" describing the note taking app, discusses source code
- Monthly MVP: notedown v3
    - I made my own note taking app, and I'm looking to finish version 3 by the end of this month
    - The note taking app uses git for your notes which 
        - version controls your notes
        - offers same workflow as writing code
- have abs (I'd be there if it weren't for the beer!)
